Something I hear much these days is: "come on, you should give up by now, get a job somewhere else! Oh, but maybe it is your dream to go to Japan. That's why you've been so patient, right?" But the truth is more complicated. I doubt anyone affected by Japan's travel ban had signed up for such a long wait. The truth, I believe, is that we've become addicted to this. I will try to make my point.

## Checking news is the new smoking

Growing up in the nineties, *addiction* is a word I was taught to associate with dangerous drugs, and wrinkled men with long beards and filthy hair. Tobacco, cannabis, alcohol, these were the kind of things that cause addiction. Physical dependence was a real threat, psychological dependence a debated side-effect. And this being France, a little glass of Bordeaux once or twice a day of course would not really count as addiction.

A few years later though, as a student in Paris, I was addicted to playing *la coinche*, a really fun cards game, popular in my previous school. I played with my classmates until late in the evenings. I knew this was an addiction, because we played especially late on days before exams, especially when none of us was prepared, and especially when we were all already sleep-deprived, and this was just one of the many boxes we checked to satisfy Wikipedia's definition of *addiction*. The word was scary, but I had managed to turn three good friends in total addicts just like me, so it was all good fun. Except for the sleeping-in-class, and the exams of course.

Fast-forward to the 21st century, we now live in an age when addiction is ubiquitous and not necessarily a drug thing. In fact, addiction is so widely accepted that it has become a business model for the world's most successful tech companies. "Because", as Bill Mayer said to a camera in May 2017: "let's face it, checking your 'likes' is the new smoking" (quote found in *Digital Minimalism* by Cal Newport). Well, for those waiting for months to restart their studies, research, work, relationships and family lives in Japan, chances are that "let's face it, checking news from Japan is the new smoking".

## Japan's travel ban as pachinko

Over the last few months, my relationship with the news has gone from largely disinterested to madly addicted. 

Even before covid, I had friends and colleagues addicted to the news. This was something I could not really understand. Why would one spend hours on checking the news, when there are so much more fun things to do? I mean, it's all pretty much bad news anyway, right? Asking a news addict why he'd not quit, is the same as asking a smoker why she'd purposely destroy her lungs. It is just missing the point.

In the 19xxs, Dr Skinner, ..., did a set of interesting experiments on pigeons. Skinner showed that pigeons could be quickly learned a habit to press a button to be rewarded with food. Press a button, get a pellet. A simple, straightforward life for those pigeons. In another experiment though, Skinner replaced the systematic reward with a variable reward. ETC


A lesser known and not-so-glorious aspect of Japanese culture is the *pachinko*. When I lived in Japan in 2018 and 2019, I did a bit of bicycle touring. When cycling through most small towns in the Japanese countryside, I typically could count on the following businesses: a non-branded convenience store, public baths, a small restaurant, usually delicious, and then hidden on the outskirt, a love hotel with a nonsensical French name, and an equally unattractive building which says "*pachinko*". Pachinkos are like casinos in Europe, except that they many more, and their architecture does not seem to suggest they are reserved to secret agents and Hollywood movie stars.

Sometimes I took my bike early in the morning, and while most activity in Japan begins quite late in the day, I was surprised to observe long lines of middle-aged men waiting to enter pachinko. There sleepy faces were probably the same as my sleepy face when I check the news every morning these days.

To those affected by travel bans, checking the news is like going to the *pachinko* and playing the slot-machine. With the uncertainty of the pandemic, and added uncertainty of the volatile political response, it is almost impossible to predict what you get when opening the news. It does not cost much to spend an hour in the pachinko, but it is well known that if it becomes a habit, gambling can ruin your wallet. Precisely because it is addictive. I think there are two differences between pachinkos and Japan's travel ban. The first is that pachinkos are designed precisely to ruin your wallet, which I hope is not the purpose of the travel ban. The second difference is that in our case, it is not only money that we gamble. It is our social life, our work, our homes and meaning. As the Okinawans put it so well, our ...

## A tentative word of advice

Thanks to initiatives like Davide Rossi's, and constructive work from many others, there is some sense of community building around people affected by Japan's travel ban. Because everyone's situation is different, it is difficult to give some kind of generic advice. But if you also feel "addicted", let me share what helped a bit in my case.

Last month, I could get a visa. We booked the flight, the two-weeks quarantine. I passed the PCR test. For a few days or weeks, I truly believed that I was going to Japan and back to work. Then we cancelled everything, and hope turned to anger. We had all kind of shocking news from Japan. More anger. But in the end I am grateful for that hope, and I am grateful for that anger, for these feelings lifted me up above the nebulous cloud of languish that has fogged my horizon for months. Instead of waiting for the border to perhaps reopen at the end of the month, I used that short burst of energy to prepare a plan B.

My plan B is to do remote work for the university that wants to hire me. It is not a satisfactory solution for anyone involved. The pay is poor (weak yen not helping), I'll need to setup my own company and sell a product, which is really not how research works, my employers are probably dealing with crazy paperwork again. To make things more complicated and embarrassing, my future boss is on a long-awaited and stressful fieldwork in Antarctica and only reachable by sat phone... But I am not exactly ready to give up, I do not have better offers yet, and most urgently I need something to keep me off the news. So it is a temporary solution, but it does feel like a good temporary solution. My employers and I are working on it, and it is looking good.

Again, I realise that everyone's situation is different. For some, a plan B will be a kind of temporary compromise or remote work like me. For others, it will be a plan to live outside Japan. For others yet, it may be a kind of new activity that does not depend on the borders status. At this moment, there are a lot of reasons to be angry with Japan's politics. Often, anger is egocentric and unjustified. But sometimes, it is correct and important to be angry. I think this is one of these times. Please make a good use of that anger energy to prepare your own plan B.
