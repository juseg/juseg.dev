I was a glaciologist working at [ETH ZÃ¼rich](http://www.ethz.ch) on field
measurements from Greenland
([Bowdoin Glacier]({% link _pages/bowdoin-glacier.md %})) and numerical
modelling of past ([Alpine]({%link _pages/alpine-ice-sheet.md %}) and
[Cordilleran]({% link _pages/cordilleran-ice-sheet.md %})) ice sheets.
