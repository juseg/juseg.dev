# About

Welcome to my personal homepage! For ten years I have worked as a
glaciologist, researching the dynamics of modern and ancient glaciers. During
my academic career I had the luck to meet very inspiring mentors and be part of
exciting research groups, particularly at [Stockholm University][SU], [ETH
Zürich][ETHZ] and [Hokkaido University][HU]. I have worked on measurements from
Greenland ([Bowdoin Glacier](/bowdoin-glacier/)) and numerical modelling of
past ([Alpine](/alpine-ice-sheet/) and [Cordilleran](/cordilleran-ice-sheet/))
ice sheets.

On a more practical level, this implies that I have spent most of the last ten
years writing Python [code](/software-data/) and then, through a collaborative
process of intense [debate](/talks-posters/), mushing it up into carefully
crafted pieces of foreign language [text](/research-papers/) and colourful
animations for [museums](/outreach/). A few times, I also had the incredible
privilege to participate in fieldwork in remote cold corners of the Earth, such
as the Canadian [Cordillera](/cordilleran-ice-sheet/) and northwestern
[Greenland](/bowdoin-glacier/#fieldwork).

# New 3D animation

Three-dimensional animation of the [Alpine glaciers](/alpine-ice-sheet/) during
the last glacial cycle. The animation begins in the upper Inn Valley before the
camera pans out over the northern Alpine foreland. Enable fullscreen to make
out the ice-sheet model grid cells, each one kilometre in width. Alternative
versions upon request.
