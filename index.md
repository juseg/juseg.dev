**New:** [Publications](/research-papers/) by Eef van Dongen et al. on
   [glacier calving](https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-485-2021) and by Ian Delaney
   and myself on [glacial erosion](https://doi.org/10.5194/esurf-2021-12). New
   animations for
   [Cordilleran ice sheet](/cordilleran-ice-sheet/#glacier-modelling)
   (also on [vimeo](https://vimeo.com/showcase/8003284)) and
   glacier erosion in the [Alps](/alpine-ice-sheet/#glacier-modelling)
   (also on [vimeo](https://vimeo.com/showcase/5585611)).

Welcome to my personal homepage! For ten years I have worked as a
glaciologist, researching the dynamics of modern and ancient glaciers. During
my academic career I had the luck to meet very inspiring mentors and be part of
exciting research groups, particularly at [Stockholm University][SU], [ETH
ZÃ¼rich][ETHZ] and [Hokkaido University][HU]. I have worked on measurements from
Greenland ([Bowdoin Glacier](/bowdoin-glacier/)) and numerical modelling of
past ([Alpine](/alpine-ice-sheet/) and [Cordilleran](/cordilleran-ice-sheet/))
ice sheets.

On a more practical level, this implies that I have spent most of the last ten
years writing Python [code](/software-data/) and then, through a collaborative
process of intense [debate](/talks-posters/), mushing it up into carefully
crafted pieces of foreign language [text](/research-papers/) and colourful
animations for [museums](/outreach/). A few times, I also had the incredible
privilege to participate in fieldwork in remote cold corners of the Earth, such
as the Canadian [Cordillera](/cordilleran-ice-sheet/) and northwestern
[Greenland](/bowdoin-glacier/#fieldwork).
