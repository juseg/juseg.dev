**New:** Ian Delaney and I have a [publication](/publications/) about
last-glacial-cycle glacier erosion potential in the Alps.
{: .notice}

Welcome to my professional homepage. I develop (mostly Python) software for the
geosciences and prepare [animations](/outreach/) of glaciers in the past. Every
now and again I still write academic [publications](/publications/).

  target="https://vimeo.com/514615725" caption="Three-dimensional animation of
  the [Alpine glaciers](/alpine-ice-sheet/) during the last glacial cycle. The
  animation begins in the upper Inn Valley before the camera pans out over the
  northern Alpine foreland. Enable fullscreen to make out the ice-sheet model
  grid cells, each one kilometre in width. Alternative versions upon request."
