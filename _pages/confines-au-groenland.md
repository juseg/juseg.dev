*[Confinés au Groenland][CAG]* is a series I wrote in April 2020 when the
coronavirus pandemic hit Europe. The stories are based on experiences lived
during two field campaigns in [Greenland](/bowdoin-glacier/) jointly organized
by [ETH Zurich][ETHZ], [Hokkaido University][HU], and the [University of
Florence][UniFI] in July 2015 and 2016. The chronological order of events is
not always respected, and the Arctic summer skies are, luckily for glaciers,
less often blue than one could think from the pictures. The reality of
glaciological field campaigns may be a little more routine than here portrayed,
but it never lacks of surprises.

If you're ready for avdenture, please [follow along][CAG] as we discover stunning
Ilulissat and charming Qaanaaq, meet Arctic hares and collect exciting science
data on Bowdoin Glacier.
