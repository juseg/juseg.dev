Thank you for taking a look at my homepage. I am a computational geoscientist
with a passion for glacial landscapes. I have a ten-years experience with
Python programming, high-performance computing (see my work on
[Alpine glaciers](/alpine-ice-sheet/)) and fieldwork in remote environments (of
the North American [Cordillera](/cordilleran-ice-sheet/) and
[Greenland](/bowdoin-glacier/)). I am a doctor from [Stockholm University][SU],
and had the luck to work and teach at other influential institutions such as
[ETH Zürich][ETHZ] and [Hokkaido University][HU].

[GFZ]: https://www.gfz-potsdam.de/en/section/earth-system-modelling/
[HU]: https://www.arc.hokudai.ac.jp/en/

These days, I work as an independent researcher, driven by the conviction that
scientific methods need to be better communicated outside universities. While
much of my work has been self-driven and voluntary, I am on the lookout for new
projects and funding (preferably remote for now). Finally, when I don't do
science, I am [cycling the world](https://cyclingho.me).
