Thank you for passing by! I am a computational and field geoscientist with a
passion for landscapes, and particularly landscapes formed by ancient glaciers.
I have experience with high performance computing (see my work on
[Alpine glaciers](/alpine-ice-sheet/)) and fieldwork in remote environments (of
the North American [Cordillera](/cordilleran-ice-sheet/) and
[Greenland](/bowdoin-glacier/)). I am a doctor from [Stockholm University][SU],
and had the luck to work and teach at other influential institutions such as
[ETH ZÃ¼rich][ETHZ] and [Hokkaido University][HU].

[HU]: https://www.arc.hokudai.ac.jp/en/

These days, I work as an independent researcher, driven by the conviction that
scientific methods need to be better communicated outside universities. While
much of my work has been self-driven and voluntary, I am on the lookout for new
projects and funding (preferably remote for now). Finally, when I don't do
science, I am [cycling the world](https://cyclingho.me).
