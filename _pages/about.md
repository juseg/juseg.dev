**New:** [Publications](/research-papers/) by Eef van Dongen et al. on
   [glacier calving](https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-485-2021) and by Ian Delaney
   and myself on [glacial erosion](https://doi.org/10.5194/esurf-2021-12). New
   animations for
   [Cordilleran ice sheet](/cordilleran-ice-sheet/#glacier-modelling)
   (also on [vimeo](https://vimeo.com/showcase/8003284)) and
   glacier erosion in the [Alps](/alpine-ice-sheet/#glacier-modelling)
   (also on [vimeo](https://vimeo.com/showcase/5585611)).

Thank you for passing by! I am a computational and field geoscientist with a
passion for landscapes, and particularly landscapes formed by ancient glaciers.
I have experience with high performance computing (see my work on
[Alpine glaciers](/alpine-ice-sheet/)) and fieldwork in remote environments (of
the North American [Cordillera](/cordilleran-ice-sheet/) and
[Greenland](/bowdoin-glacier/)). I am a doctor from [Stockholm University][SU],
and had the luck to work and teach at other influential institutions such as
[ETH ZÃ¼rich][ETHZ] and [Hokkaido University][HU].

[HU]: https://www.arc.hokudai.ac.jp/en/

These days, I work as an independent researcher, driven by the conviction that
scientific methods need to be better communicated outside universities. While
much of my work has been self-driven and voluntary, I am on the lookout for new
projects and funding (preferably remote for now). Finally, when I don't do
science, I am [cycling the world](https://cyclingho.me).

# New 3D animation

Three-dimensional animation of the [Alpine glaciers](/alpine-ice-sheet/) during
the last glacial cycle. The animation begins in the upper Inn Valley before the
camera pans out over the northern Alpine foreland. Enable fullscreen to make
out the ice-sheet model grid cells, each one kilometre in width. Alternative
versions upon request.
