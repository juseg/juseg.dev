Thank you for taking a look at my homepage. I am a computational geoscientist
with a passion for glacial landscapes, currently working at the [Department of
Biological Sciences][BIO] at the [University of Bergen][UIB]. I have used
Python programming, high-performance computing (of glaciers dynamics) and
fieldwork in remote environments (of the North American Cordillera and
Greenland) to try and understand glacier changes past and present.

This website is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and hosted on
[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com). It is powered by
[Keels](https://juseg.github.io/keels), which is my custom fork of Jekyll theme
[Sleek](https://janczizikow.github.io/sleek) and an attempt to teach myself a
little something about web development.
