Thank you for taking a look at my homepage. I am a computational geoscientist
with a passion for glacial landscapes. I have a ten-years experience with
Python programming, high-performance computing (see my work on
[Alpine glaciers](/alpine-ice-sheet/)) and fieldwork in remote environments (of
the North American [Cordillera](/cordilleran-ice-sheet/) and
[Greenland](/bowdoin-glacier/)). I obtained my doctorate at [Stockholm
University][SU], and had the luck to work and teach at other influential
institutions such as [ETH Zürich][ETHZ] and [Hokkaido University][HU].

[ETHZ]: https://vaw.ethz.ch/en/research/glaciology.html
[GFZ]: https://www.gfz-potsdam.de/en/section/earth-system-modelling/
[HU]: https://www.arc.hokudai.ac.jp/en/

Since the beginning of the pandemic, I have been unemployed. Driven by the
conviction that scientific methods need to be better communicated outside
universities, I try and continue my research and science communication
work, independently and at my own glacial pace. When I get bored about it, I
take my bike [cycle the world](https://cyclingho.me). I am always on the
lookout for cool projects and especially funding, so don't hesitate to
[contact](/contact/) me.

This website is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and hosted on
[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com). It is powered by
[Keels](https://juseg.github.io/keels), which is my custom fork of Jekyll theme
[Sleek](https://janczizikow.github.io/sleek) and an attempt to teach myself a
little something about web development.
