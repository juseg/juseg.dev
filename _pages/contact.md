To contact me you will need to decipher this little enigma (don't worry, it
works). But before you write, I ask that you please go through the short FAQ
section below.

**Warning:** After a frustrating and soul-crushing nine-months-long
[wait for Japan](/research-is-not-tourism-the-long-wait-for-japan/),
I am slowly catching up on a long backlog of unanswered email. I mean to reply
to all of you, but it will take time. Thank you for understanding!

**Email:**
   *first name two first letters* +
   *last name three first letters* + at +
   *posteo* and then dot + *eu*.

I read French, English, German and Swedish.
