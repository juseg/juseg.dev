To contact me you will need to decipher this little enigma (don't worry, it
works). But before you write, I ask that you please go through the short FAQ
section below.

**Email:**
   *first name two first letters* +
   *last name three first letters* + at +
   *posteo* and then dot + *eu*.

I read French, English, German and Swedish.


## Frequently asked questions

Can we display your animations in our museum?
: Yes, please! All my animations are available under
  [CC BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/). If you wish to
  apply stricter copyright, it is likely that I accept, too. In any case,
  please get in touch. I maintain a [list](/outreach/), and hope it
  will help me continue such work in the future.

Can you send the data for your paper?
: Much of (but not all) my data is long-term archived on
  [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org). The links can be found in my
  [publications](/publications/) list.
  Of course, if data you need are missing, please ask.

Can you prepare a new animation for us?
: Yes! I currently don't have a fixed contract, thus I am available for hire on
  a consulting basis. I am often eager on science communication work, so please
  get in touch and let us discuss a price.

Do you need more visibility? It's good for your CV.
: No! I have all the visibility that I wish for. All I need is a salary, big
  computers, loving colleagues and ample time for my work. Please do not use
  the visibility and "good for your CV" arguments in your emails.

Can I give your email to Elsevier?
: Definitely, no. I do not have an academic affiliation. I pay for this email.
  Please do not enter it on *any* website. Unless, of course, you want me to
  hate you forever.
