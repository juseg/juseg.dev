works). But before you write, I ask that you please go through the short FAQ
section below.

**Email:**
   *first name two first letters* +

## Frequently asked questions

Can we expose your glacier animations?
: Yes, please! All my animations are available under
  [CC BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/). If you wish to
  apply stricter copyright, it is likely that I accept, too. In any case,
  please get in touch. I maintain a [list](/museums-exhibitions/), and hope it
  will help me continue such work in the future.

Can you send output data for your paper?
: Much of (but not all) my [data](/software-data/) is long-term archived on
  [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org). For Copernicus publications the links are
  typically hidden under "code and data availability" and the
  [assets](https://tc.copernicus.org/articles/12/3265/2018/tc-12-3265-2018-assets.html)
  tab. Of course, if data you need is missing, please ask.

Can you prepare a new animation for us?
: Yes! I currently don't have a fixed contract, thus I am available for hire on
  a consulting basis. I am often eager on science communication work, so please
  get in touch and let us discuss a price.

Do you need more visibility? It's good for your CV.
: No! I have all the visibility and CV items that I want. At the moment I only
  need a salary, a big computer and some time for my work.

Can I give your email to Elsevier?
: Definitely, no. I do not have an academic affiliation. I pay for this email.
  Please do not enter it on *any* website. Unless, of course, you want me to
  hate you forever.
