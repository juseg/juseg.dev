Context
-------

All around Greenland, glaciers flowing into the ocean react more strongly to
climate change than the rest of the ice sheet. Because ice is lighter than sea
water, when these glaciers thin, more and more of their weight is taken up by
the ocean, allowing them to flow faster. A critical factor in the physics of
fast glacier flow is the ice temperature. Similarly to honey or melting
plastic, the viscosity of ice depends strongly on its temperature. Warm ice
flows faster than cold ice.

From to 2014 to 2019, our team has visited Bowdoin Glacier (Kangerluarsuup
Sermia), a fast-flowing and highly crevassed terminal part of a Greenlandic
ocean-terminating glacier. The glacier was first explored by western explorers
in the late-nineteenth century and described in the following terms:

> Beyond that, an isolated mountain of striking boldness and sharpness of
> outline jutted into the air apparently some two thousand feet, and then, from
> its base, the crystal wall of a great glacier stretched clear across the
> opposite side of the bay head. This glacier I named, in honour of my Alma
> Mater, Bowdoin Glacier, and the bay I called Bowdoin Bay (Robert E. Peary,
> *Northward over the Great Ice*, 1898, p. 393--394).

Field work
----------

The logistically demanding field campaigns to Kangerluarsuup Sermia were
organised in collaboration with colleagues from the Institute of Low
Temperature Science ([ILTS][ILTS]) and the Arctic Research Center ([ARC][ARC])
of Hokkaido University ([HU][HU]) in Japan. A part of this project consists in
investigating continuous measurements of borehole ice deformation, pressure and
temperature from Bowdoin Glacier.

The temperature measurements indicate the presence of a deep, local heat source
within the glacier. Our interpretation is that every summer, meltwater
penetrates deep into the glacier through crevasses that extend from the surface
to the bottom or nearly the bottom of the glacier. The zero-degree water then
refreezes in winter, warming up the surrounding ice and thus making it softer.
These results shed light on a new mechanism contributing to the observed
acceleration of ocean-terminating glaciers in Greenland.
