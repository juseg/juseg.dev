I find that glaciers and glacial landscapes are gorgeous. Of course, I have
worked on them for a long time, so I am not very objective about it. But I
imagine at least some people agree with this.


## Glacier animations

To enjoy the beauty of present glaciers, you can use a pair of hiking boots, or
a good photography book. But through my work, I also find beauty in glaciers
that existed thousands of years ago. When I examine my modelling results, I
imagine the great glaciers flowing steadily through the mountains, excavating
the valley floor and building little moraines where we see them today.
When researchers publish their results, though, we cannot be so poetic about it
(just look at my [publications](publications)). This is why I like to spend a
lot of time computing colourful and attractive glacier animations. While these
reconstructions are not everywhere accurate, I hope those watching will become
interested about glaciers and understand them in a new way. I think this has
become a very important part of my work.

## Museums and exhibitions

My glacier animations have been reused in several museums and exhibitions. I
am trying to keep a list of them here. While I do not have the budget to travel
to all these places, if you happen to visit one of them, please do not hesitate
to [get in touch](/contact/) and send photos. It will be hugely appreciated!
