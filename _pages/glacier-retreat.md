Throughout the Alps glaciers currently experience rapid retreat. Even over a
short time interval of four years, this retreat and the thinning of glaciers is
well visible from satellite images. Use the browser's zoom for full resolution.
The images speak for themselves.

Glacier Blanc is one of the southernmost glaciers in the Alps. Between 2015
and 2019 the thin terminal tongue retreated quickly making it more and more
difficult to organise ice training from the nearby refuge. Glacier Noir on the
bottom half of the pictures now consists of two independent glaciers. Also note
the Spring 2016 rock avalanche on Bonne Pierre Glacier to the left. I could
find no accounts from it in the news, perhaps because this side of the
mountain is uninhibited in winter.

The Glaciers de la Vanoise are a group of glaciers that (still) connect to form
a relatively broad continuous ice field in the French Alps of Vanoise. In
recent years, the accumulation zone has been reduced to a patchy region around
the highest domes. Also note debris-flow activity in the valley to the west of
the image.

The Mer de Glace is one of the first places where systematic glacier studies
were conducted, at a time when it extended down to the valley of Chamonix. The
ogives, successive layers of clean and dirty ice, deform more and more as they
travel downglacier due to higher velocities along the centerline, and record
year-to-year glacier motion. Note how the unstable glacier banks evolved as
several new gullies appeared between the summers of 2015 and 2019.

Swiss Alps

### Gorner Glacier

The junction between the upper and lower parts of Gorner Glacier has finally
vanished. The terminal tongue tongue of the Gorner Glacier (upper left) is
now exclusively only fed by the Grenz Glacier flowing from Monte Rosa (lower
right). While a new trail to the Monte Rosa hut has been opened, in the future
it might be possible to reach the hut, located south of the lakes on the
nunatak in the centre right of the pictures, without stepping on the ice. The
images also show supraglacial rivers diplaced downstream with the flow, and
frontal retreat of the terminal tongue.

### Aletsch Glacier

The Aletsch Glacier, the largest in the Alps, retreated 300 metres in only
four years. The images also show that the glacier thinned significantly
between 2015 and 2019. The retreat of the glacier provoked destabilization of
the mountain slopes near the tip, where trees fell due to landslides. Moraines
with different ages can be seen on the north slope. Note how the ice cover in
the higher mountains is also diminishing.

### Unteraar Glacier

   caption="Unteraar Glacier in 2015 and 2019." %}

Thanks to the many rock debris covering the surface of the Unteraar Glacier,
the eastward motion of the glacier between the two images is well visible. A
patch of rock-covered dead ice detached from the glacier snout almost
completely disappeared, while the smaller, Oberaar Glacier visible on the lower
half of the picture is also retreating. Again, one can also observe the retreat
of smaller glaciers at high elevations.

### Rhone Glacier

Between 2015 and 2019, the Rhone Glacier became thinner and the glacial lake
at the front grew a bit larger. The white patch at the southern tip of the
glacier consists of large white blankets designed to protect the underlying
ice cave open for tourism. It has the same colour with snow and allows the
ice below to melt slower than its surroundings.

   caption="Morteratsch Glacier in 2015 and 2019." %}

While the terminal tongue of Morteratsch Glacier is slowly melting under a
thick layer of rock debris, the area of clean ice clearly diminished between
2015 and 2019. The snout of the Pers Glacier, to the right, also retreated,
causing a river to appear, that now connects between the two glaciers.

### Adamello Glacier

   caption="Adamello Glacier in 2015 and 2019" %}

The Adamello glacier, a large ice plateau in the eastern Italian Alps, has
nearly completely lost its accumulation area. Between 2015 and 2019, the
glacier is not only retreating from lower elevation areas but also clearly
downwasting. The rate of mass loss is large enough so that in just a few years
one can see rocky peaks and new ridges emerging from the ice surface.
